Caesar Cipher Implementation
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to implement a Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique that shifts each character in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Description
This script provides a simple way to encode or decode messages using the Caesar cipher method. The user can input a message, specify a shift value, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message. The script then processes the input and returns the transformed message.

How It Works
Input:

Message to be encrypted or decrypted.
Shift value (integer).
Mode (encrypt or decrypt).
Processing:

Iterates through each character in the message.
Shifts letters by the specified value while preserving spaces and non-alphabetic characters.
Maintains the case of letters (uppercase or lowercase).
Output:

Displays the transformed (encrypted or decrypted) message.
Dataset
No external dataset is required. The input is provided by the user.

Installation and Setup
Python Environment: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Script Execution: Save the script and run it in a Python environment or IDE.
Input
Message: The text that you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Shift Value: An integer that represents the number of positions each character in the message will be shifted.
Mode:
e for encryption
d for decryption
Usage
Run the script.
Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the shift value (an integer, positive for forward shift and negative for backward shift).
Enter the mode:
e for encryption
d for decryption
Example
Encrypting a message:

Input Message: HELLO WORLD
Input Shift Value: 3
Input Mode: e
Output: KHOOR ZRUOG
Decrypting a message:

Input Message: KHOOR ZRUOG
Input Shift Value: 3
Input Mode: d
Output: HELLO WORLD
Notes
The shift value can be any integer. A positive value shifts characters forward, while a negative value shifts them backward.
The mode must be either 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.
